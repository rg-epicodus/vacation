              <p>We stayed in a yurt for the trip.  The cost was low so we got to splurge on other things like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-danger">A visit to the spa for mom and dad</li>
                <li>A kite to fly at the beach in the wind</li>
                <li>Some souvenirs at the aquarium</li>
                <li class="bg-success">A nice dinner when we got home</li>

          <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
          <p class="bg-warning">First we got in the car and then after going to the gas station, we filled up the gas tank.  It took about 3 hours to drive to the aquarium, the weather was sunny and warm.  It was a beautiful day.  Once we got into Newport we stopped by Rogue Brewery for lunch.  We had some beer first and got the kids Root Bear.  I had an appetizer of fries with some melted chees on them and then a Kobe Beef Hamburger.  Aimee got a Salmon fillet.  We were not really excited about the food, we cook better at home, but it was nice not having to worry about washing a bunch of dishes afterward.</p>
